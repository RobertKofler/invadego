# Insertionbias intro

We are simulating an insertion bias into piRNA clusters. The bias may go from -100% to 100%

 * -100%: complete bias against piRNA clusters; no TE will ever jump into a cluster
 * +100% complete bias towards piRNA clusters; all TEs will jump into a piRNA cluster
 * 0% no bias; the probabiltiy to jump into a piRNA cluster is bascially the total size of the cluster (as fraction)
 
 But how to model this with some mathematical equation? My idea is actually based on the equations used for computing the allele frequency of selected allele.
 
 Here is the implementation in R
 
  * pc: probability for a cluster insertion; computes the probability that a TE will jump into a piRNA cluster, give some insertion bias (bias) and some total size of the piRNA clusters (clufrac)
  * bias: insertion bias of the TE; from -100 to +100
  * clufrac: total size of the piRNA clusters in percent of genome; eg in Drosophila piRNA clusters account for 3% of the genome
 
 ```{r}
pc <- function(bias,clufrac){
genfrac<- 1.0-clufrac
bias <- bias/100
clufit <- (bias+1.0)/2.0
genfit <- 1.0 - clufit
totfit <- clufrac*clufit + genfrac*genfit
p<-(clufrac*clufit)/totfit
}
```

## Visualize the insertion bias

The following curve shows how the insertion bias (ranging from -100 to 100) is translated into the probability that a TE will jump into a piRNA cluster (p-cluster: ranging from 0 to 1). In the case of **NO** bias the insertion probability is equal to the total size of the cluster (dashed line). The following curve shows the results for four different sizes of piRNA-clusters. Note that a realistic scenario, for example in Drosophila, corresponds to **3%**. Further note that this is going to be implemented as unit-test ensuring the correct implementation of the insertion bias in the Go software.

 ```{r}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
p3<-pc(-100:100,0.03)
p10<-pc(-100:100,0.1)
p50<-pc(-100:100,0.5)
p97<-pc(-100:100,0.97)
df<-data.frame(bias=rep(-100:100,4),insprob=c(p3,p10,p50,p97),cluster_size=c(rep("3%",201),rep("10%",201),rep("50%",201),rep("97%",201)))
 
g<-ggplot(df,aes(x=bias,y=insprob,col=cluster_size))+geom_line()+xlab("insertion bias")+ylab("p-cluster")+
geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype="dashed")
plot(g)
```
