InvadeGo - Chassis branch
================

# Info about branch
The chassis branch should represent the simplest possible scenario of simulations of TE invasions with piRNA clusters. It mainly ought to serve as a backbone for the development of other more complex simulations

## Assumptions
* hermaphrodites with fitness depending mating probability; self-mating is not excluded;
* non-overlapping generations of a fixed population size (N)
* genome may be several chromosomes with some recombination rate
* simulated regions: piRNA clusters and reference regions
* all TEs are equal, so TEs have just a position in the genome; 
* TEs may have negative effects; negative effect of insertions in clusters can be switched off
* no fancy stuff (i.e. no paramutations)
